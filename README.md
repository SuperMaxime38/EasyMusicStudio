# EasyMusic Studio

EasyMusic Studio is a little java software to compose noteblock musics for EasyMusicStudioAPI minecraft plugin.



## Features

- Easily set the song duration (in tick)
- Load a song file and save it (yeah it's obvious)
- A really nice timeline
- Switch last note's value with UP/DOWN Arrow keys


## Roadmap

- The play/stop feature is actually unavaiable (i gotta get every single minecraft note before)

- Adding .nbs file support

- The plugin that comes with this software will be post someday

- Adding an easier way to edit/set a note value


## Installation

### Windows users :
> You can download the windows zip, it contains the app wrapped in an executable (.exe) file and his dependencies. The exe must be in the same directory as his dependencies. Still you can make a shorcut.

### Linux users :
> Download the linux zip, it contains a directory called "application" and a shorcut. Application contains the dependencies, the jar file and the start.bat required to start it. The shorcut point to the start.bat file. If your linux installation cannot run batch files, well do you linux things, the bat just point the jre java.exe, put the javafx requirements in arguments and run the jar. I'm sure you can do an easy thing to make it work I trust you ! :)

## Known Issues

- Well sometimes I'm stupid. On the pre-release I posted a version that have the following bug : When you change the duration of the clip, it will reset the wole timeline. The bug has been fixed on my side. I will post the good version for the next update (because nobody will read that... and I'm lazy).
